    "**Mean/ Mode/ Median Imputation:** Imputation is a method to fill in the missing values with estimated ones. The objective is to employ known relationships that can be identified in the valid values of the data set to assist in estimating the missing values. Mean / Mode / Median imputation is one of the most frequently used methods. It consists of replacing the missing data for a given attribute by the mean or median (quantitative attribute) or mode (qualitative attribute) of all known values of that variable. It can be of two types:-\n",
    "- Generalized Imputation: In this case, we calculate the mean or median for all non missing values of that variable then replace missing value with mean or median. Like in above table, variable “Manpower” is missing so we take average of all non missing values of “Manpower”  (28.33) and then replace missing value with it.\n",
    "- Similar case Imputation: In this case, we calculate average for gender “Male” (29.75) and “Female” (25) individually of non missing values then replace the missing value based on gender. For “Male“, we will replace missing values of manpower with 29.75 and for “Female” with 25.\n",
    "- Prediction Model:  Prediction model is one of the sophisticated method for handling missing data. Here, we create a predictive model to estimate values that will substitute the missing data.  In this case, we divide our data set into two sets: One set with no missing values for the variable and another one with missing values. First data set become training data set of the model while second data set with missing values is test data set and variable with missing values is treated as target variable. Next, we create a model to predict target variable based on other attributes of the training data set and populate missing values of test data set.We can use regression, ANOVA, Logistic regression and various modeling technique to perform this. There are 2 drawbacks for this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model estimated values are usually more well-behaved than the true values\n",

The similarity of two attributes is determined using a distance function. It is also known to have certain advantage & disadvantages.\n",
    "    1. Advantages:\n",
    "        k-nearest neighbour can predict both qualitative & quantitative attributes\n",
    "        Creation of predictive model for each attribute with missing data is not required\n",
    "        Attributes with multiple missing values can be easily treated\n",
    "        Correlation structure of the data is taken into consideration\n",
    "    2.Disadvantage:\n",
    "        KNN algorithm is very time-consuming in analyzing large database. It searches through all the dataset looking for the           most similar instances.\n",
    "        Choice of k-value is very critical. Higher value of k would include attributes which are significantly different from           what we need whereas lower value of k implies missing out of significant attributes.\n"
